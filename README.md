# Steel Expansion Calculator

This app is a tool for mechanical engineers and technicians to calculate the temperature required for the assembly of internal diameter of steel in another piece. It uses the inputs of the exact measurements of the two pieces and calculates the expansion of the steel and the temperature needed to mount one piece on another.

## How to use

The app has a simple UI, with two input fields where you can enter the exact measurements of the two pieces. One input is the exact diameter of the piece to be expanded and the other is the desired expansion in decimal of millimeter. Then you can just press the calculate button and will be displayed the temparature you need to heat in Celsius.
